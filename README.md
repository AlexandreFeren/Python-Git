This is primarily an exercise for me to better understand source control, with the intention of making a basic functional source control system.
## Goals
- CLI through argparse library
- Majority test coverage over the full project
- Commit pipeline, run test coverage
- Ability to push to GitHub

### Functions

- init, clone
#### Work on local version
- commit, add, remove, ignore file
#### Branching/Collaboration
- branch, merge, status, pull, push, fetch, rebase
