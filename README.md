## Goals
This is an exercise for me to better understand source control, with the intention of making a basic functional source control system.

### Initialization
- init
- clone (?) This would be working entirely locally at least for now
### Work on local version
- commit
- add
- remove
- ignore file
### Branching/Collaboration
- branch
- merge
- status
- pull
- push
- fetch
- squash commits

###  Sources
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ (mostly chapter 10: Git Internals)## Goals
